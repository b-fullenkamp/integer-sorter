# Integer Sorter
This repository contains two Java implementations of an integer sorting program. In both versions, the user inputs a list of integers and the program sorts them in ascending order.

- `integer-sorter-linkedlist` uses a **LinkedList** to store and sort the input.
- `integer-sorter-stack` uses a **Stack** to store and sort the input.

Each folder includes its own `README.md` file with:
- Instructions to compile and run the program.
- Example test cases.
- Instructions to generate the Javadoc documentation.

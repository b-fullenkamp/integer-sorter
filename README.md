# integer-sorter
This repository contains two implementations of an integer sorting program. The user is asked to input a list of integers then the program sorts the numbers in ascending order and stores them in a LinkedList in one version and a Stack in the other version.

## Note
- Each folder's `README` file contains the instructions to run the code and generate the Javadoc files.
